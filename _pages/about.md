 am working as a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at Miami University, USA. I am also a member of the SMART (Social-Mobile-and-Internet-of-Things) research group. I completed a Ph.D. in Computational Sciences from Marquette University. I received my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Military Institute of Science and Technology (MIST), Bangladesh and M.Sc. degree in Computational Sciences from Marquette University, USA.

My research centers in an interest in contributing to a deeper understanding of the context in big data ubiquitous computing environment. My research interests include artificial intelligence, data science, machine learning, ubiquitous computing, indoor localization, and human activity recognition. The foundation of my research has applied the knowledge from computer science, applied mathematics, and statistics. I have experience in developing mathematical models, performing data analysis, applying statistical and machine learning techniques, and building mobile computing systems. My researches have been applied in multiple areas including healthcare, rehabilitation research, occupational science, psychology, microbiology, and pervasive computing.

I strongly believe in the importance of education in a society. Computer science is a unique field of study which is now being applied to a wide range of areas from biology to space research. I believe that the importance of computer science education is more essential than ever before. I consider teaching an integral part of being a researcher, and I am committed to providing an excellent classroom experience for both undergraduate and graduate students. It is a wonderful opportunity to educate and influence students that comes with an awesome responsibility.

I hope you enjoy my website and find some useful information here. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
