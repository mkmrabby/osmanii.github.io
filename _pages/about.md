I am working as a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at Miami University, USA. I completed a Ph.D. in Computational Sciences from Marquette University. I received my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Military Institute of Science and Technology (MIST), Bangladesh and M.Sc. degree in Computational Sciences from Marquette University, USA. I am also a member of the SMART (Social-Mobile-and-Internet-of-Things) research group. 

My research centers in an interest in contributing to a deeper understanding of the context in big data ubiquitous computing environment. My research interests include artificial intelligence, data science, machine learning, ubiquitous computing, indoor localization, and human activity recognition. The foundation of my research has applied the knowledge from computer science, applied mathematics, and statistics.
